Turbo defines `test` with `dependsOn: ['^build']` and `outputs: ['coverage/**']` (`turbo.json`), so tests depend on builds.\n- `apps/api` tests use Fastify `app.inject` and a custom config override to set `NODE_ENV: 'test'` (`apps/api/src/modules/health/__tests__/health.routes.test.ts`).\n- `apps/web` has only a utility test (`apps/web/src/lib/utils/time.test.ts`), and `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` sets `environment: 'node'` with no Svelte/Vite plugin integration.\n- `packages/shared` has multiple `.test.ts` files located in `src/` (for example `packages/shared/src/utils/type-guards.test.ts`).\n- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm --filter <pkg> test -- --coverage ...` and uploads `**/coverage/**` artifacts.\n\n## Gaps vs Issue Requirements\n- Missing root `vitest.workspace.ts`.\n- Missing `apps/api/vitest.config.ts` and `packages/shared/vitest.config.ts`.\n- `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` should use `jsdom`/`happy-dom`, Svelte testing setup, coverage config, and aliases. Current config does not.\n- Missing test utilities directories and setup files under `apps/api/src/__tests__/` and `apps/web/src/__tests__/`.\n- Missing Svelte testing dependencies (`@testing-library/svelte`, plus `jsdom` or `happy-dom`).\n- Missing `test:watch` and `test:coverage` scripts (root + packages) and corresponding Turbo tasks.\n- Required test globs exclude existing `*.test.ts` files outside `__tests__` unless updated.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n- Vitest was added early (dependencies and a few smoke tests), but full configuration and utilities were deferred.\n- Only the web package received a stub `vitest.config.ts` during scaffold; API/shared configs never landed.\n- DOM testing dependencies were not added, blocking component tests.\n- Workspace-level Vitest orchestration (`vitest.workspace.ts`) was not created, so test execution is per-package only.\n\n## Impacted Modules / Files\n- Root: `vitest.workspace.ts`, `package.json` (scripts), `turbo.json` (tasks).\n- API: `apps/api/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/api/src/__tests__/setup.ts`, `apps/api/src/__tests__/helpers/db.ts`, `apps/api/src/__tests__/helpers/factory.ts`.\n- Web: `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/web/src/__tests__/setup.ts`, `apps/web/src/__tests__/helpers/render.ts`, `apps/web/package.json` (devDependencies).\n- Shared: `packages/shared/vitest.config.ts`.\n- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` only if script names/paths change.\n\n## Constraints / Dependencies\n- ESM repo (`\"type\": \"module\"`), so Vitest config files must be ESM/TS.\n- `@the-dmz/shared` exports point to `dist/`; API/Web tests currently rely on shared being built (Turbo test depends on build, and CI builds shared before tests).\n- Svelte 5 compatibility: ensure `@testing-library/svelte` version supports Svelte 5.\n- DD-09 expects module tests under `__tests__/` directories; DD-08 expects unit + component + E2E coverage.\n\n## Options / Approaches\n1. **Follow the issue spec closely (recommended)**\n- Add root `vitest.workspace.ts` with `['apps/api', 'apps/web', 'packages/shared']`.\n- Add per-package `vitest.config.ts` with env, coverage provider, setup files, and include globs.\n- Add `@testing-library/svelte` + `jsdom` (or `happy-dom`) to `apps/web`.\n- Add test setup helpers and a simple Svelte component smoke test.\n\n2. **Unify via root workspace config only**\n- Use `vitest.workspace.ts` plus minimal per-package configs.\n- Optionally alias `@the-dmz/shared` to source to avoid build dependency, but that diverges from current CI/build assumptions.\n\n## Risks / Tradeoffs\n- **Test glob mismatch**: restricting to `**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` + `**/*.spec.ts` will skip existing `*.test.ts` outside `__tests__`. Either expand globs or relocate tests.\n- **DOM env dependency**: `environment: 'jsdom'` requires adding `jsdom` (not currently in `apps/web`).\n- **Svelte 5 compatibility**: confirm `@testing-library/svelte` version supports Svelte 5.\n- **Build dependency**: API/Web tests import `@the-dmz/shared`; without source aliasing, they require the shared build (current CI already does this).\n- **Watch mode**: `apps/web` `test` script runs preflight scripts; watch mode may need a lighter script to avoid rerunning these on each change.\n\n## Test Ideas / Validation\n- `pnpm test` runs all package tests via Turbo.\n- `pnpm --filter @the-dmz/api test` passes Fastify `inject` health route tests.\n- `pnpm --filter @the-dmz/web test` runs a Svelte component smoke test under `jsdom`/`happy-dom`.\n- `pnpm --filter @the-dmz/shared test` runs schema/type-guard tests.\n- `pnpm test:coverage` generates `coverage/` output.\n- `pnpm test:watch` runs in watch mode without repeatedly failing preflight scripts.\n","createdAt":"2026-02-06T10:44:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/the-dmz/issues/13#issuecomment-3859627372","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2026-02-05T15:23:29Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOQ_FFzs8AAAACXIw6vQ","name":"M0: Bootstrap","description":"Milestone 0: Project Bootstrap","color":"1D76DB"},{"id":"LA_kwDOQ_FFzs8AAAACXIw81A","name":"testing","description":"Testing infrastructure","color":"FBCA04"}],"number":13,"title":"M0-13: Set up Vitest unit testing infrastructure","updatedAt":"2026-02-06T10:44:57Z","url":"https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/the-dmz/issues/13"}
