# The DMZ: Archive Gate

## Core Premise

A new Stuxnet variant has crashed most of the public internet. Governments, universities, and major companies are desperate to preserve what they can. Matrices GmbH, led by Morpheus, operates one of the last functioning data centers with a strict policy of safety and security. We decide who gets access to recovery services. Hackers know this and attack constantly. Access is limited. More money means better servers, cooling, and security, but our main job stays the same: deciding who gets in.

## World State

- The public web is fragmented; only a few isolated networks still run.
- Trust is broken. Every request could be a trap.
- Most applicants can only reach us by email.
- Data loss is existential, not just financial.

## Player Role

- Final authority on access decisions.
- Balances survival, ethics, and security.
- Drives profit and increases automation through purchased security tools.
- Manages upgrades funded by accepted clients.

## Access Constraints

- Limited rack space, bandwidth, and power.
- Storage is leased for a fixed number of days, then reclaimed for resale.
- Priority shifts daily based on threat level.
- Each approval increases attack surface.

## Upgrade Loop

- Funds increase capacity, cooling stability, and security tooling.
- Upgrades improve acceptance rate, resilience, and automation.
- Every upgrade triggers new threat vectors.

## Verification and Phishing Simulation

- Requests arrive by email; verification is handled like a real phishing review.
- The game trains players to identify legitimacy and avoid social engineering.

## Breach Consequence

- A successful breach triggers a ransom note.
- The ransom costs total earnings divided by 10, rounded up with a minimum of €1.
- Operations stay locked behind the ransom note until payment is confirmed.
- If we can pay, we lose money; if we cannot, we lose the game.

## Primary Threats

- External attackers probing for entry.
- Supply chain malware hidden in backups.
- Adversaries become more sophisticated as we scale up.
